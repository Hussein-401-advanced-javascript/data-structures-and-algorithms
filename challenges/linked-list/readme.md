## Reverse an Array
- In the **Code Challenge: Class 05**(Linked List) I will Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node. 
## Challenge
-Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
